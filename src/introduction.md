# Introduction

Performance is important for many Rust programs. 

This book contains techniques that can improve the performance—speed and memory
usage—of Rust programs. It also contains some techniques that will improve the
compile times of Rust programs. Some of these techniques only require changing
build configurations, but many require changing code.

This book is aimed at intermediate and advanced Rust users. Beginner Rust users
have more than enough to learn and these techniques are likely to be an
unhelpful distraction to them.

Some of the techniques within are entirely Rust-specific, and some involve
ideas that can be applied (often with modifications) to programs written in
other languages. The techniques are practical: many are accompanied by links to
pull requests that show how the technique was used on a real-world Rust
program.
